THANKS

Romain Dolbeau for testing the first generation code on a variety of platforms
including: Supermicro mainboard with dual HD 5870s; nVidia Tesla Fermi C2050;
PS3 with STI Cell. Romain gave very valuable feedback at an early stage of
development that contributed to the second generation technology roadmap.
